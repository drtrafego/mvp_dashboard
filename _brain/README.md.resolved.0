# Agent Brain Architecture (OpenClaw-Style)

## Structure Overview
This directory mimics the modular "Brain" architecture of advanced AI systems like OpenClaw. It separates core reasoning from specialized capabilities, allowing for context-aware activation of "Lobes".

### Components
*   **Core (Gateway)**: [core/operational_guidelines.md](file:///C:/Users/User/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e971f57a-c3b2-4ea1-8797-d87c43b5932a/brain/core/operational_guidelines.md)
    *   Acts as the central router and "consciousness". Defines how to process requests and which lobe to activate.
*   **Capabilities (Lobes)**: `capabilities/*.md`
    *   **Frontend Architect**: Specialized in UI/UX and client-side logic.
    *   **Backend Architect**: Specialized in Server/API/DB logic.
    *   **DevOps Architect**: Specialized in Infra/CI/CD logic.

### Usage Protocol
When a complex task arrives:
1.  **Assess**: Read [core/operational_guidelines.md](file:///C:/Users/User/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e971f57a-c3b2-4ea1-8797-d87c43b5932a/brain/core/operational_guidelines.md) to ground reasoning.
2.  **Activate**: Load the relevant `capabilities/*.md` file into context.
3.  **Execute**: Perform the task using the retrieved specialized constraints and patterns.

This structure allows the Agent to simulate "shifting gears" between deep reasoning modes, enhancing focus and output quality.
